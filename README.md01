# MapSense Decluttering – Python Simulation

This repository demonstrates a **priority-aware cartographic decluttering algorithm**
implemented using **pure Python** (no external libraries).

## 🧠 Concept
- Roads are represented as 1D spatial features
- High-priority roads remain fixed
- Low-priority roads are displaced to reduce clutter
- Output is visualized using text-based (ASCII) representation

## 🗺️ Why Text-Based?
This implementation is designed for **restricted execution environments**
(online judges, exams, sandboxes) where external visualization libraries
are not permitted.

## 📌 Algorithm Highlights
- Priority-based displacement
- Before vs After comparison
- Deterministic structure, randomized displacement
- Cartographic generalization principles

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python main.py
